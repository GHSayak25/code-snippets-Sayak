There is a list type field named 'Reviewers' on Policy records.
On the list view of Policies, we want to highlight with field styles, where any of the user listed under Reviewers is inactive.
In the screenshot attached below, Daniel Zill is inactive user, and if he is present in Reviewers, the respective column value is applied with defined field styles.
